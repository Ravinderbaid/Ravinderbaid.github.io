Redis and ElastiCache are related but serve different purposes:

1. **Redis**:

   - **What it is**: Redis is an open-source, in-memory data structure store. It can be used as a database, cache, or message broker.
   - **Features**: It supports various data types like strings, hashes, lists, sets, and sorted sets. Redis also offers features like persistence, replication, and high availability.
   - **Use Cases**: It's commonly used for caching, session storage, real-time analytics, and as a message broker.

2. **Amazon ElastiCache**:
   - **What it is**: ElastiCache is a managed caching service provided by AWS that supports Redis and Memcached.
   - **Features**: It handles setup, scaling, and maintenance tasks for you. With ElastiCache, you get automatic backups, monitoring, and patching.
   - **Use Cases**: It's used to enhance the performance of applications by providing a managed cache that reduces latency and increases throughput.

In summary, Redis is the underlying technology, while ElastiCache is a managed service that uses Redis (or Memcached) to provide caching solutions in the AWS cloud.
